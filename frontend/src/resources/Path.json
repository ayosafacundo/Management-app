    "text": "What I wanted to make was a big, all-in-one webapp that featured all the necesarry skills I would need to learn and polish, but at the same time I needed something that was easy enough for me to do without suffering from burnout, so I got to thinking, and thinking got to searching, and searching got to asking an AI for help, and when all that failed, I went to a website I had found called 'sharpen.design'. The website is essentially a challenge creator for designers, using names and random number generators to create a challenge that you then went up and made for your portfolio. So, when I went into the website, it created the perfect challenge for me: 'Design a management app for UC Berkely'. Challenge I ended up modifying to 'Create a Homepage and entire Campus' for a ficticious University.",
